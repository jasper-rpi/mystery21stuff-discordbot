# mystery21stuff-discordbot
my first discord bot

decided to upload the files for my first ever discord bot. doesnt have much use right now, it is only in 1 public server. code isn't the cleanest code ever written, but its good enough for me. laused.txt houses the custom sentences that have been added, rest_chan.txt houses the list of restricted channels, nool.txt is for the nool command and scoor.txt is for the scoor command.
might do an english version of help if this actually gets noticed.
